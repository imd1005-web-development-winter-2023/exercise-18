## Steps

Since you now experts at cloning repos, one option open to you is that you could clone this `Exercise-18` repo and then work on it locally.

If you aren't as comfortable with cloning just yet, you can copy the HTML, CSS and JS files in the main project folder to your local machine and modify the `javascript-start.css` file until you acheive the desired outcome. In this exercise you must not modify the main HTML file or CSS file to acheive the desired outcome.

Please note that you should not be editing the CSS reset file.
